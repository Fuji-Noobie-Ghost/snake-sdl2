## SNAKE GAME implemented with C++ and SDL2 library

You need to have makefile support (make) and g++ installed in your system

* Install SDL2
  * by following instruction in the [SDL Github Repository](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/INSTALL.txt)
  * by following instruction in this [Link](https://www.matsoon.com/prog/sdl2-mingw-w64-tutorial) (particularly for windows user). If you choose this option, you just need to extract "include" and "lib" from "x86_64-w64-mingw32" to the project root and extract "SDL2.dll" and "sdl2-config" to the "bin" directory that you need to create

* Create a directory "bin" in the project root if not exists
  ```bash
  mkdir bin
  ```

* Run the build command
  ```bash
  make build
  ```

* Run the game with the command
  ```bash
  make run
  ```

Use your arrow keyboard to control the snake
